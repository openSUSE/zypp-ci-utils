File .env
=========

CI_ROOT_VOLUME=/Local/ZCIWorkspace
- Path where the outer and inner workdirs are mounted. As long as
  git-new-workdir is used by ZCIbuild, both paths must be the same because
  new-workdir always uses absolute paths to symlink into the master checkout
  dir. ZCIbuild just builds inside the container but uses sources and artifacts
  in CI_ROOT_VOLUME.
- For ZCI - which also does OBS submissions - everything is kept inside
  the container. Just the OBS credentials are expected to be provided in
  CI_ROOT_VOLUME/ZCI/CONFIG/oscrc.

CI_UID=216
CI_GID=50
- Ids for user/group zci inside the container. The local CI_ROOT_VOLUME should
  allow reads (ZCI) and writes (ZCIbuild).

Layout:
    CI_ROOT_VOLUME/			# inside and outside the container
	# by ZCI:
	+- ZCI/CONFIG/
	    +- oscrc
	# by ZCIbuild:
	+- 'PRJ'/
	    +- ARTIFACTS/
		+- 'PKG'/		# make package artifacts
		+- 'PKG'.label		# git checkout of artifacts
	    +- 'PKG'/			# git source checkout

    PRJ like 'head', 's12sp2', 's11ltss' (try maching the `oscsubmitt` tags)
    PKG like 'libsolv', 'libzypp', 'zypper'
