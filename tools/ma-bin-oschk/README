Backup/Source of internal OSC check and release scripts
=======================================================

For now, to avoid inconsistencies, scripts and configs are maintained at
(git@github.com:openSUSE/zypp-ci-utils.git) in tools/ma-bin-oschk.

Team-mates should call {oscchk,oscconf,oscsubmitt} there or symlink those
scripts scripts into their $PATH. Scripts will use REALPATH(1) to find the
relevant configuration file and - in case of oscsubmitt - place the logs into
the git directory.


https://smelt.suse.de/maintained/?q=zypper may help to figure out where
we need to send the maintenance requests to, and which are distributed
by maintenance internally.
