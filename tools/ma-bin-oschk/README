Backup/Source of internal OSC check and release scripts
=======================================================

For now, to avoid inconsistencies, scripts and configs are maintained
in my bin/ dir. All scripts refer to this location. Team-mates should
call ~ma/bin/{oscchk,oscsubmitt} directly or link to those scripts.
