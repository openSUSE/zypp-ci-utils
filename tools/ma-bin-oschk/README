Backup/Source of internal OSC check and release scripts
=======================================================

- Most off my scripts use colored output. You may need to source
the colorecho file before using them. It provides the required
Recho Gecho Becho Cecho Mecho Yecho shell functions.

- The scripts expect 'osc' and 'git-obs' (for gitea) commands
  to be configured to access *.opensuse.org.
- 'isc' and 'git-ibs' configured to access *.suse.de.

Traditional obs workflow (ATM TW and Code15)
------------------------
For now, to avoid inconsistencies, scripts and configs are maintained at
(git@github.com:openSUSE/zypp-ci-utils.git) in tools/ma-bin-oschk.

Team-mates should call {oscchk,oscconf,oscsubmitt} there or symlink those
scripts scripts into their $PATH. Scripts will use REALPATH(1) to find the
relevant configuration file and - in case of oscsubmitt - place the logs into
the git directory.

https://smelt.suse.de/maintained/?q=zypper may help to figure out where
we need to send the maintenance requests to, and which are distributed
by maintenance internally.


New gitea workflows
-------------------
- Set GITEAUSER to your gitea account in the environmnet.
- Use "giteastats --help" for hints about the setup (chek it shows you as GITEAUSER).
- 'obs' and 'ibs' subdirectories mus exist in CWD otherwise the script exits.

===[giteastats --help]==========
PreReq:
- GITEAUSER configured: "mlandres"
- PKGS configured: libsolv libzypp zypper libzypp-testsuite-tools zypp-plugin
- Set up 'git-obs' and 'git-ibs' commands to refer to src.suse and src.opensuse.
- Create empty 'obs' and 'ibs' subdirectories we use for cloning the repos.
- Login to src.suse and src.opensuse and fork the packages from pool/PKG.
  (or do it on the commandline; the script will hint if a fork is missing)

The script basically updates parent/factory to local factory and determines the
difference to the potential parent PR branches. Tries to figure out if needed
PRs are already open or need to be openend. In both cases a submission needs to
sync local factory to origin/factory, because thet's the source of all PRs.
Recognized PR targets are:
    obs: parent/leap*
    ibs: parent/slfo*

Skip "obs" per default because there are no leap* branches for our packages.
Use "-v obs all" to check obs.

Without PKG args it checks the core stack only (libsolv, libzypp, zypper). Pass
package names or use "all" to check specific packages.
